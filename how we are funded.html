			<h1>How are we funded?</h1>

			<p>	Panda Playgroup is a registered charity, whose stated aim is:</p>

			<p>	<i>"To enhance the development and education of children, primarily under statutory school age, by encouraging parents to understand and provide for the needs of their children".</i></p>

			<p>Our complete Charitable Framework can be found on the Charity Commission website by clicking this link.</p>

			<p>We are a registered charity who do not make a profit.  Our primary sources of income are:
			<li>Session fees
			<li>Government funding
			<li>Workplace childcare voucher schemes
			<li>Grants and charitable donations
			<li>Fundraising

			<p>This income covers the day-to-day running costs such as:
			<li>Staff wages
			<li>Staff training
			<li>Venue hire
			<li>Insurance
			<li>Play and educational equipment
			<li>Administration costs

			<p>We try to keep our fees as low as possible and utilise fundraising as a way of meeting expenditure for new equipment and resources.  Fundraising also ensures that we have enough reserves to make sure that we can still run effectively in years where the number of children is lower than our break even.</p>
			<p>Invoices are issued on a half-termly basis and we accept childcare vouchers (from Computershare Voucher Services, Accor Edenred Childcare Vouchers, KiddiVouchers and Fideliti), cash and cheques. Unfortunately we cannot accept BACS payments at the moment.</p>

			<p>Note: Nursery Education Funding is available from the term following a child&#39s third birthday. Please visit www.yor-org.uk/childcare for further details.</p>
			<p>Please contact the vice-treasurer with any questions regarding fees and funding.</p>
