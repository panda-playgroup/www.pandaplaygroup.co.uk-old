						<p><i>"I achieved Early Years Teacher Status in July 2015. This followed a BA (Hons) in Educational Leadership- Children's Workforce in 2014. I became Panda Playgroup Leader in January 2017 starting my career in childcare in 2000. First as a childminder. Moving onto Preschools as my children moved on to school. I have done various courses in childcare including Cache Level 3 in childminding practice, NVQ in Children's care, Foundation Degree completed in 2013 followed by BA and EYTS.</p>
						<p>I have done a wide range of courses in special needs including Speech and Language, Autism, Disability Awareness, Portage, Sensory Impairment and Forest Schools. I enjoy helping the children learn new things and love to celebrate their achievements. I am dedicated to give the children in my care the best possible outcome. I continue my own professional development to keep up to date with the latest learning and development.</p>
						<p>Being the playgroup leader I am responsible for supporting the staff team in their development and learning. As a team we deliver a high quality provision where the children are at the heart of everything we do."</i></p>
