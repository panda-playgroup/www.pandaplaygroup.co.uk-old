				<ul class=a>
					<li>Ensuring that Panda fulfills its regulatory responsibilities with Ofsted and the Charity Commission.</li>
					<Li>Ensuring that their responsibilities as an employer are fully met.</Li>
					<li>Managing, retaining and recruiting staff.</Li>
					<li>Managing third party relationships with bodies such as the Council, Howell Hall, Early Years Partnership and York CVS.</li>
					<li>Budgeting, applying for grants and fundraising.</li>
				</ul>
