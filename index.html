					<p>We have been at the heart of Copmanthorpe village for a long time, in fact, this year is our 40th birthday!  We are a registered charity, run by a voluntary committee of trustees mainly made up of Panda parents and carers.</p>
					<p> Our different sessions provide local pre-school children with an exciting journey of learning through play from birth to school. We aim to help parents find somewhere safe and welcoming to come and have fun with their children, meet other parents and get a taste of what Panda Pre-School has to offer. To find out more about Panda Pre-School, please visit our <a href="Panda Pre-School.html">Panda Pre-School</a> section.</p>

					<!--<p>Our <a href="Sticky Mitts.html">Sticky Mitts</a> session is a drop-in Baby & Toddler Groups run by Panda pre-school Playgroup. Each week, during school term time, we hold three sessions (on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays) at the Methodist Church Hall in Copmanthorpe from 9:15 - 11:15 am. These sessions are &pound3 per adult and child, plus &pound1 for each extra sibling that comes along, and this includes a healthy snack for your child and a hot drink and biscuits for you! If you love the session why not come along more than once? Enjoy a reduction for a second visit in a week. Find out more about our sessions and which days they run by clicking on the menu above.</p>
