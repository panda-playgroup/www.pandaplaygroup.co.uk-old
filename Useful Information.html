				<H3>Settling In Visits</H3><!--We did not have an annual prospectus at the time of writing-->
				Before your child starts at playgroup, you will be invited to come in for two settling-in visits. Each visit will last around an hour. There is no cost for attending settling-in visits but they must be arranged in advance.
				<H3>Key Workers</H3>
				All of our children are allocated a key worker, who is responsible for working closely with you to help settle your child into playgroup.  They also have a longer term responsibility to provide the best learning outcomes for your child, communicate your child&#39;s progress with you and maintain a dedicated learning journal. This learning journal provides a record of your child&#39;s interests and development, using photos, comments and artwork.
				<!--<H3>Duty Rota</H3>
				The Aims and Charitable Framework of Panda Playgroup emphasise the importance of working with parents.  To reinforce this, we ask all parents to give up a little of their time to be part of the Duty Rota.  This  not only provides support for our hard working staff, but also gives you a great insight into a typical Panda day.  Typically you will be needed for one session per half term.--><!--This was not the case at the time of writing-->
				<H3>Getting Involved</H3>
				We would love you to get involved with our Playgroup sessions, by bringing your own work, hobbies, skills or interests to share with the children. You might, for example, be a member of the Emergency Services, own chickens, have an active interests in crafts or keep exotic pets.  If you think you have skills, hobbies or interests that would be of interest to our children, please let us know by getting in touch using our contact us form.
				<H3>Panda Prospectus</H3>
				Our annual Prospectus provides you with a detailed view of Panda Playgroup.<br>
