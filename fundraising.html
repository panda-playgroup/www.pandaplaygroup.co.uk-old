				<H1>Fundraising</H1>
				<p>As we said on the "How We Are Funded" page, fundraising is extremely important in ensuring that Panda continues to be an important asset to our village community.  We are always on the lookout for volunteers so please speak to one of the committee or use the contact form if you are interested in helping out.</p>

				<h2>Easy Fundraising & Easy Search</h2>

				<div class="funding img"><a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="IMG/easy funding link.gif" alt="Easy funding logo"></a></div>

				<p>If you shop online, use Easy Fundraising, where you can access over 2700 online retailers, such as the popular ones on the right.  Panda Playgroup gets a percentage of the retail price for whatever you buy, so instead of going directly to a retailer's website, check if they are on Easy Fundraising first.  It's  free to use and your shopping won't cost you a penny more.  Easy Fundraising has raised over &pound700 for Panda to date. <i>Just click on the image to register for Easy Fundraising.</i></p>
				<br>

				<div class="funding img"><a href="http://www.easysearch.org.uk/" target="_blank"><img src="IMG/easy search logo.png" alt="Easy search logo"></a></div>
				<p>Easy Fundraising also operates a fundraising tool called Easy Search.  If you use this as your default web browser Panda will earn 0.5p every time you search for something.  It may not sound much, but if you use Easy Search to search just 15 times a day, you will raise &pound27 a year in a year. <i>Just click on the image to access Easy Search.</i></p>

				<p>This year Panda Pre-school has been selected to be a recipient of the Co-op's Local Community Fund.  If you are a member of the Co-op, you will already know that everytime you shop you accrue cash on your membership card, which can be used in store at a later date.  Did you know, you can also select a charity, who will also recieve funds at no cost to yourself?  Please, if you are not already a member, join the Co-op and help our funding, otherwise, if you are a member and are already supporting Panda's, thank you very much.
