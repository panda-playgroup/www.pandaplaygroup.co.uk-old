				<p>At Panda Preschool we believe we have a responsibilty to protect this planet for our children.  We have excellent recycling facilities on our doorstep (see below), and we encourage our children to learn about recycling.  We are also doing our best to reduce our plastic use and we commit to becoming a glitter free setting this year!

					<h4>Sprouts</h4>

					Right outside Howell Hall we have access to the Copmanthorpe Community Garden, which is (mostly) maintained by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CopSprouts/about/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">Sprouts</a>, a group of local, green fingered, grow-your-own enthusiasts.  We say 'mostly' because the Panda children have a bed of their own to grow fruit and veg all year round, giving them the chance to learn about how food grows, whilst getting covered in mud (we're not sorry).

				<h4>Recycling</h4>
					<em>We are currently updating this section - check back soon!</em>

						<h4>Website</h4>
							<p>The company who host our website, Kualo (you can visit their site <a href="https://www.kualo.co.uk/webhosting/green-web-hosting" target="_blank">here</a>), have a fantastic outlook.  Not only is our website covered by their charity hosting, which means it doesn't cost us a penny, they also have great employment standards and they are powered by renewable energy.
